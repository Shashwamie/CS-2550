                <br><h2>My personal interests</h2>
                <p>My favorite hobby is playing video games... Yes I know that is very boring and typical of someone that is in the CS field<br> 
                but hey something has to get us interested in tech. Video games for me is somehting that I can just get lost in and allow me<br>
                to capture other worlds and forget about daily stressors. Something interesting is that I do not play any multiplayer games,<br>
                I strictly like to find single player games that I can just take over as the character and make them me and enjoy the fun gameplay<br>
                or story. I have found it vary hard to find other people that share this similar interst in games. I swear everyone just only plays<br>
                the popular shooter or sports games, and I just don't get it.</p>
                <p>My second favorite hobby is mountain biking. I actually didn't start biking until after I graduated high school and man was<br>
                I sad on what I had been missing out on. I find it really exciting to go out into the mountains and be away from most people and<br>
                technology. I find it really rewarding and calming to climb the mountain just deep in my own thought while getting a good workout.<br>
                Than the fun part is descending the mountain as fast as I can to test my skills. Overall it is by far my favorite hobby that makes<br>
                me feel good about myself instead of sitting inside on my computer at all times...</p>
                <p>The last hobbie of mine that I will place in being one of my favorites is skiing. This is one that I grew up doing because it was one<br>
                of the main reasons my parents decided to live in Utah. I have been skiing since I was three years old and have been doing it as much as I<br>
                can every winter since. This becomes my get off the computer hobbie during the winter when I am not able to mountain bike. Skiing has become<br>
                more of my social hobbie that all of my friends also do, so most days it is just up in the mountains enjoying our time out there.</p>
